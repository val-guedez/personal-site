            <li> This site is a tribute to those cringey 90s-00s About Me Pages (it did get a bit unhinged im sorry i couldn't help it i always wanted to make one i ended up forgetting people will actually see it and it was too late)</li>
            <li> vscode pets is love, vscode pets is life </li>
            <li> i chose the countries in the profile page because i have travelled to them (can you identify them all?) </li>
            <li> i was born in mexico and can speak spanish (hence the bienvenido in the home page)</li>
