                    god i really hate mandarins THEY STINK! LITERALLY WHAT IS THE REASON?? stupid
                    crunch and sip in primary school was a nightmare because the stench would linger
                    and it could be consumed 1km away from me AND I WILL STILL SMELL IT like how could you 
                    consume such a stinky, horrifying fruit unphased? i will never forget when my own
                    mother opened one of those demonic artifacts while i was driving WHEN IT WAS 40 DEGREES
                    so i had to choose between death by mandarin stench or death by a literal hairdryer burning
                    me if i rolled down any of the windows THE STENCH LINGERED FOR AN HOUR it was torture
                    if you choose to eat one of those ******* in my vicinity i will consider it an act of war.
                    mandarin (i hate you).

                    thank you for coming to my ted talk.
                    you deserve financial compensation for reading this far (do not use it to buy mandarins).
                    *gives you robux*
